The other day, I installed the next macOS Ventura updateÂ â€” version 13.2. And the question arose before me, should I use the built-in shell, or should I update it?

A quick web search yielded no answers, so I decided to compare the versions.

```sh
zsh --version
```

**zsh 5.8.1 (Ã—86_64-apple-darwin22.0)**&nbsp;â€” the typical version supplied by Apple.

Checking which version is in Homebrew

```sh
brew info zsh
```

![Azsh default version in Ventura 13.2](/images/2023/02/zsh-m1-ventura-13.2.png)
**zsh: stable 5.9 (bottled), HEAD**&nbsp;â€” version that can be obtained via Homebrew.

At first glance, we can see that Homebrew has a newer version. However, this is what catches my eyeÂ â€” <kbd>Ã—86_64</kbd>, which suggests that this is a version for Intel, not for Apple Silicon. ðŸ˜•

## The decision is to update!

```sh
brew install zsh
```

Restart shell

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

and check the version of the installed shell

```sh
zsh --version
```

Let's compare

> zsh 5.8.1 (***Ã—86_64***-apple-darwin22.0)Â â€” Intel (Ventura 13.2)  
> zsh 5.9 (***arm-***apple-darwin22.1.0)Â â€” Apple Silicon (Homebrew)

The updated version of zsh 5.9 is the version specifically for Apple Silicon ðŸš€, it is strange that the version of macOS created for M1/M2 contains an assembly for Intel.

If you have an M1/M2 Apple SiliconÂ â€” I advise you to install the version of zsh compiled specifically for your processor.
